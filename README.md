# opencv-python-tutorials

A place to play around with the [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html).

# Python 2.x or 3.x?

I use Python 2.x - seems to work fine so far. (As well as Anaconda IDE for Python 2.x).

# OpenCV 2.x or 3.x?

Even though the OpenCV 2.x version is very mature and well documented, the [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) are written base on OpenCV 3.x version.

When I first started the tutorial I used OpenCV 2.x - but when I progressed I realized the need to try out OpenCV 3.x (So what the tutorial produces mataches to what I produce locally on my machine).

As now I have a mix of OpenCV 2.x and 3.x codes, for now, I shall differentiate the two by (naively) code naming convention.

All OpenCV 3.x code will have suffix `_3x`.

All OpenCV 2.x code will be named as it is (no `_2x` suffix).

At some point in future I guess I will have separate repositories, one for OpenCV 2.x, and one for OpenCV 3.x.

But for now I incline to keep things simple.
