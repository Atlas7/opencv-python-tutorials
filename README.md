# opencv-python-tutorials

A place to play around with the [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html).

# Python 2.x or 3.x?

I use Python 2.x - seems to work fine so far. (As well as Anaconda IDE for Python 2.x).

# OpenCV 2.x or 3.x?

Even though the OpenCV 2.x version is very mature and well documented, the [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) are written base on OpenCV 3.x version.

When I first started the tutorial I used OpenCV 2.x - but when I progressed I realized the need to try out OpenCV 3.x (So what the tutorial produces mataches to what I produce locally on my machine).

To prevent having a mix of OpenCV 2.x and 3.x codes, I shall stick to OpenCV 3.x for the duration of the [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) as suggested by the Authors.
