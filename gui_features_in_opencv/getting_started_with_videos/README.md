# Getting Started with Videos

## Prerequisites:

- If run via an IDE (like Anaconda). Make sure to change the current working directory to where this directory (i.e. where the Python file and the input video file is stored). The code uses relative pathnames. So this is mandatory for the Video Capture and writer steps.
- Make sure the `ffmpeg` codec is installed and works within OpenCV. This [Stackoverflow forum](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23119413/how-to-install-python-opencv-through-conda) has provided a good tip on getting this done. Check out the solution by user [eculeus](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2012659/eculeus). This is mandatory for the Video Writer step.

## Test Instructions:

So here are the files that we have to begin with:

- `load_video.py`: the python code that we are going to run.
- `all_blacks_skills_part_2.mp4` the video that we are going to use to test run our code.


Run the `load_video.py`. If run via IDE, take heed of the Prerequisites section above!
